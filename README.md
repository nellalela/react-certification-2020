# Mini-Challenge 2: Intro to Testing

## Answer the following questions first
1. Using `create-react-app`, what do we need to set up for testing?
```
The packages for testing are included, if we want to use a differente one we need to install it. Also we can create the setupTests.js file to avoid the setup in each test.
```
2. What components are worth to test in your development?
```
Those with a sub routine logic and the ones that have user interaction.
```
3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
```
Yes, but I imagine that if those components are already in production it may be a long and incremental process. Or it can be applied for looking for an already known bug. 
```
